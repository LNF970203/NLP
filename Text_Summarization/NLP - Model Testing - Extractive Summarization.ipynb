      "So let's start by talking about why should you have a co-founder at all. The second reason is moral support. And that's what you get from a co-founder. But Y Combinator has funded single founders, and we have done so successfully. So there really no solution is necessary. They're ready to go. So Drew applied Y Combinator way, way back now, in 2007. He had a really solid idea for building Dropbox, because he'd already felt the pain of losing his own files. And can you really make progress without having a co-founder? And are they someone that's going to stick around when things are tough? I didn't need them too much. So that's totally fine. And usually that means someone who's got complementary set of skills to you, right? I don't think it's one you should overly fixate it. All right. And they want to build an iPhone app. Like what kinds of skills are you actually good at as opposed to what you might think you're good at? Projects that you work on in your spare time often tend to be some of the greatest sources for actually finding great startup ideas and building huge companies. Facebook's an obvious example, something that started out as a project while Mark Zuckerberg was an undergrad at Harvard. And ask them if they're up for working on things in the evenings or weekends. How do you start finding co-founders? Say you understand. But like, who would they start a company with and make it very specific. So your list keeps growing now. And then you meet with those people. So they're not just sort of completely random strangers. But maybe also just attend or find people who are interested in the kinds of things you're interested in. But even in regular times, there's always ways to find people that have similar interests to you. So once you found a potential co-founder, how do you test out and know for sure that you both want to start a company together before making the final commitment? Well, it's not a perfect process. So making that a little bit more tangible. Say that, \"Hey, we're going to set aside a month or three months. And all the work is years and years ahead of you. However, we have seen different equity arrangements, and they have been successful. Startups are a really long-term game and you win by making the best decision long term. Now, this can sometimes be an uncomfortable conversation. So practically, it doesn't matter, like, in terms of who does what. And this kind of gets the point of where really the only impact the CEO title has. And this can sort of...we can see this in Y Combinator interviews, where you end up with two people who kind of talk over each other, they interrupt each other, they can look at each other with a little bit of content when the other person's answering. This is really important.\n"
