      "In our series of letters from entrepreneurs, Harj Taggar looks at why you should have a co-founder when you're starting a company. The first reason I'd say to have a co-founder when you're starting a company is that you're more likely to have a co-founder who's invested in the success of the company. In our interview with Paul Graham, the founder of Y Combinator, he explains why he doesn't fund companies founded by two people: Here's what Dropbox co-founder Drew Houston had to say about bringing on a co-founder: The first thing you want to look for in a co-founder is whether or not they've been through a tough time.
