# Representing Words in vector format

### 1. Doc2Vec

- There are many advanced techniques used in NLP, such as bag-of-words, bag-of-n-words, word2vec, etc, for representing the words in a vector format. This is required for developing advanced applications such as language models, text summarizers, etc. Doc2Vec is a similar technique of representing words in a vector form. This model comes with several benefits as compared to the popular Word2Vec model. In this article, we will discuss the Doc2Vec model with an easy way of implementing it using Gensim. The major points to be discussed in this article are listed below.

### 2. Word2Vec
- Word2Vec creates vectors of the words that are distributed numerical representations of word features â€“ these word features could comprise of words that represent the context of the individual words present in our vocabulary. Word embeddings eventually help in establishing the association of a word with another similar meaning word through the created vectors.
